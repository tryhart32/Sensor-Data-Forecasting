# ðŸ“Š Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost â€” Temperature and Humidity Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using the XGBoost regression model to predict temperature and humidity values based on real-time sensor data collected every 8 seconds over a span of **3 months and 9 days**. The data was obtained from a **DHT11 sensor**, which is commonly used in IoT systems for environmental monitoring.

## Key Objectives
- Preprocess timestamped data including temperature and humidity.
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Build a regression model using **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**.
- Evaluate the model using performance metrics and visualize predictions.
- Compare actual vs predicted results to understand model accuracy.

## Why XGBoost?
XGBoost is a powerful and scalable machine learning algorithm well-suited for time series regression tasks. Its key advantages include:

- Handling non-linear relationships.
- Resistance to overfitting through regularization.
- High performance on tabular data.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data preprocessing
- **XGBoost** for modeling
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for evaluation and train-test splitting

## Project Outcome
The model successfully predicted temperature and humidity trends, offering a robust approach for environmental condition forecasting. This project is highly relevant for applications in **smart cities, agriculture, IoT monitoring systems**, and **climate control** in automated environments.
