## Key Objectives
- Preprocess timestamped data including temperature and humidity.
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Build a regression model using **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**.
- Evaluate the model using performance metrics and visualize predictions.
- Compare actual vs predicted results to understand model accuracy.
